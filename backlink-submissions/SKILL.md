# Backlink Submissions Skill

Use this skill when you ask me to submit `https://chatgptimages.pro/` (or future sites) to directories / backlink sites (e.g. Twelve Tools, Wired Business).

## What This Skill Stores

- Your site profile (domain, name, description, category)
- Public asset URLs (logo/icons) and notes about what *won’t* work (e.g. localhost)
- A per-directory “required fields” checklist so we can submit faster next time
- A log of where we have already submitted

## Reference Files

- `references/site.md` — Your website + contact details + assets
- `references/directories.md` — Each directory’s submission requirements + prepared checklist + submission log

## Operating Rules (Fast Path)

1. Prefer `https://` URLs for submissions.
2. Logo must be publicly accessible (no `localhost`), ideally square PNG ≥ 128×128.
3. Before clicking the final “Submit/Pay” button, confirm any required checkbox statements (backlink/badge/policy).
4. Save proof (success page URL + screenshot) after submission.
